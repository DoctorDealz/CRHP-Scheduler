# CRHP Schedule Hub

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to provide a web-based schedule and agenda-management tool for retreat weekends, specifically focused on CRHP (Christ Renews His Parish) retreats. It allows event organizers to build, edit, print, and share detailed schedules for each day, specify rooms and team roles, upload/download agenda JSON files, and manage checklists and tasks to keep the event on time. It features a schedule editor, a schedule viewer, and a print service, all designed to help retreats run smoothly and on time. More details will be added later.
